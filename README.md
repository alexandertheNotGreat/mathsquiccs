# How to Use it
`fat(x)ยน` creates the factorial for a number like `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5...` 

`times(x, y)` multiplies a number(x) with another(y)

`gett(x, y, z, a...)` you can add (infinite) numbers to it.

`sqrt(x)` makes the square root(x * x) of a number.

`divide(x, y)` divides (two) numbers(x, y). 

# Principal
make (i think) math easy on your program,
look on the docs for more info.

i'm gonna try upload it on binaries releases..
